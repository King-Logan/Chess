# Chess
A small personal project to develop chess in Java over the course of a few weeks in Feb 2021. 
This game is represented entirely in the Terminal through use of ASCII characters. 

Run main from Board.java and follow the instructions to play! 


Unimplemented Features
* En passant 
* Castling  
* The game does no handling for if a King piece is in check.
